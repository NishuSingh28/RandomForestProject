# Random Forest Classifier

A supervised machine learning algorithm called Random Forest is based on ensemble learning. In this kernel, two Random Forest Classifier models—one with 10 decision trees and the other with 100—are used to predict whether a person earns more than $50,000 per year. The number of decision-trees in the model increases the expected accuracy. Finding only the most crucial features, rebuilding the model with these features, and evaluating the impact on accuracy are done using a feature selection process using the Random Forest model. For this project, a data set for income classification is used.





## The problem statement:
-----------------------------------------

The prediction task for this kernel is to ascertain whether a person earns more than $50,000 annually. The application of Scikit-Learn and Python's Random Forest Classification. The Random Forest classifier is used to determine whether or not an individual earns more than $50,000 annually.
For this project, a data set for income classification is used.
